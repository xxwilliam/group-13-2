<p><h2>Cyber Security,</h2></p>

<p><b>Cyber Security by Samantha Kurilic.</b></p>

<p>What is Cyber Security and what does it do? Cyber security is a practice known for protecting sensitive information and important critical systems, from digital attacks. A cyber attack can be detrimental to individuals and organisations computers and networks, why? It is an assault by cybercriminals using one or more computers. A cyber-attack can steal data, disable computers, or use a compromised computer or other devices as a launchpad for other attacks maliciously.   
In society, computers and devices such as Ipad’s, tablets, and smartphones are everyday devices that individuals use every day. This can start from internet banking, connecting with family and friends, online shopping, creating accounts with usernames and passwords and so much more.</p>
<p> Questions you would ask yourself is, are these usernames and passwords the same as your banking and online shopping with saved credit cards to keep consistency? How scary to think that if you chose generic login details and you had a security threat and you were hacked. In this instance, this proves it is super important to protect yourself from security threats.   
Important things to think about and to ensure you remain safe from cyber attackers, is to follow basic cyber security practices. Such as keeping your software up-to-date, install software patches, delete expired browser certificates and allow browsers to force HTTPS. Other protectors such as using a VPN, anti-malware, ensure you check emails before opening and secure online accounts.</p>
<p.What is Cyber security? Cyber security is a collection of processes, practices, technologies and security tools and it is used to protect software, devices, applications and more, inside and outside organisations. IBM topics, Cybersecurity-what is cybersecurity, paragraph 2.</p>
<p>The state of the art in cyber security is aimed to protect against security threats to ensure confidentiality, integrity and other private information remains secure and how amazing this invention is. The boundaries of the field of cybersecurity are constantly and rapidly evolving and it can be challenging to identify which areas have been researched and which ones remain overlooked or poorly understood.
As quoted by RAND <b>“The identified gaps include: a lack of research into cybersecurity within the national security context; the governance of cybersecurity; ethics and legal concerns; and a number of emerging topics such as the dark web, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and quantum-related technologies."</b> RAND Europe is unique and able to find evidence-based solutions to policy challenges in today's fast-changing times.
<b>“Daily reports on security incidents in companies and authorities show that there is an urgent need for action to improve IT security."</b></p><p> Article 32 of the GDPR regulates <b>"security of processing"</b> to ensure that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. ENISA and TeleTrust – IT Security Association, paragraph 2&3, published Feb, 7th, 2019.
A panel of Cyber Security Experts shared their views on what is next in Cyber Security via ‘IT Security Central, sponsored by Teramind. The following insight was from Stefan Maerz who is a cyber security engineer for Titan and Summit, two of the world’s fastest supercomputers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Stephen Maerz says <b>“Cyber security in 5 years,"</b> will not be all that different than it is today, to be honest — every year the Verizon data breach report comes out and it more or less tells us the same thing. We need to build security as a fundamental component of our technology architecture.. There is no easy button in security.</p><p> The state of the industry hasn’t evolved much in the past 5 years — I don’t foresee a reason it will change tremendously in the next 5”. Panel of Cyber Security Experts, IT Security Central, cyber security in five years the top experts speak.
What is the potential impact of this development? Cyber Security is definitely an area that needs more attention but unfortunately, it is given the least, it is a vast field of discussion in the IT sector and such a delicate area.<b> "Sauvik Acharjee says “</b> the lack of awareness and deprivation of knowledge about cybersecurity creates a more favourable situation for hackers. The first few words that pop up mostly in people’s minds after hearing the word <b>‘cyber security’</b> are about cyber-attacks by hackers on various international security forces and financial banks or theft of personal details of a company through bug attack.</p><p> Sauvik Acharjee, 19 Feb 2021, Jigsaw Academy.
Talking about the impact of cyber security on business, as reported by Jigsaw, “the first thing that came to mind, are two famous ransomware WannaCry and Not Petya which uses Eternal Blue exploit tool to damage 300,000 windows machines leaving victims to pay $300 to $600 as Ransom amount with an estimated data loss worth 19 million euros, according to the department of health and social care. Not Petya strike of 2017 created more hue and cry among the people leaving its impact of cyber security on society by hitting numerous large organizations throughout the world. A few of them were Maersk and FedEx whose data have been shared publicly showing a loss to that organization worth $250-$300 million. In 2015, a notable ransomware TeslaCrypt encrypted various file extensions linking to various online games leaving impact Minecraft hacks as encrypted for customers”.jigsawacademy/blogs/cyber-security/impact-of-cyber-security
According to IBM, It has been recorded in the US that the average data breach cost was 3.86 million globally and 8.6 million in the United States these costs are broken down into discovering and responding to the breach itself. This includes long-term reputation damage, the cost of the downtime that is involved and loss of revenue for the business and the brand itself. IBM topics, Cybersecurity-what is cybersecurity, paragraph 2.</P>      	
<p>Ecpi University has shared its views on how Cybercriminals affect and target individuals and not just large companies and organisations. <b>“While a CEO can afford a dedicated cybersecurity team," the average person is on their own when it comes to securing their computers and devices. That leaves millions of potential targets vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can range from the sort of data theft and ransomware that is used to target organizations to more personal attacks that aim simply to cause chaos and distress”.</b> Gainful Employment Information – Cybersecurity Track - Bachelor's
Being attacked by Cyber-attacks can be a real risk for me and my family, we rely on our smartphones to conduct all our banking, online shopping and my children watching their favourite content and setting up generic accounts to access all these streams. These attacks are real and the potential risk for me is no different than the next person, the only difference is, it depends on what security programs I access and how I manage my accounts with passwords, using VPN and removing previous browsing history.
This is a great insight on how cyber security can affect my family <b>“Although kids have an advantage in their almost innate grasp of the concepts of technology,"</b> they’re still kids. Their naivete puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to security in general and particularly on the internet. What’s worse, they often use the internet in secret. Some of the more shocking statistics show that 86% of girls aged 12-17 say they can chat online without their parents’ knowledge. Additionally, 57% say they can get into their parents’ email, which helps them circumvent parental controls.
By teaching children cybersecurity basics — including both the why and how — adults can prepare them for the risks they face and what to do when they encounter them. Plus, kids who grow up with a strong foundation in these practices can even begin to fill the cybersecurity skills shortage and help keep everyone safe”.

<h3><b>Similarities, Differences and Conclusion:</b></h3>
 
<p>Desktop support and IT support are very similar to each other but also different in a few ways. Both these jobs require advanced Customer Service skills. Other Skills needed and Qualifications needed for these jobs are also almost identical to each other. Desktop support personnel help resolve the basic customer problems regarding any product e.g., shipping status, return policies, they do not help with technical issues, while IT support personnel help with resolving the technical problems of customers e.g., installing software, resolving or fixing hardware malfunctions.</p>
Cyber security Analyst and Cyber Forensic Analyst both focus on protection of digital assets. The work they both do is very similar but still different in some ways. Cybersecurity is basically about prevention. Cyber Security Analyst prevents the organizations from cyber-attacks, Cyber forensics is about response. If the cyber security fails, a Cyber forensics Analyst can help identify the problems or hacks and help resolve them. Cyber security personnel’s help build the security system and Forensic personnel’s help resolve the issues in the case of a breach.
Our ideal jobs and Career pathways are very different from each other. Some of us want to start from entry level jobs and progress our career on the way and others intend to complete qualifications needed and then start a career. Skills, Qualifications or responsibilities might differ but eagerness to start a career in IT is the same.

<h1>Group Job Titles:</h1>

<p>All four people in our group have different interests and different career paths. The job titles for our group’s ideal jobs are as following.</p>

<ul>
· <li>        Cyber Security Specialist <b>(William Hansen).</b></li>
· <li>        Cyber Forensics Specialist <b>(Madiha Sabahat).</b></li>

· <li>        Desktop Support <b>(Samantha Kurilic).</b></li>
</ul>
 
<p>In our group Cyber Security specialist is the top ranked job in demand from employers. According to this blog <b>( https://blog.y-axis.com/which-occupations-are-in-demand-in-australia-in-2021/)</b> ICT security specialists rank 20 overall in Australia in demand from employers this year. In the past few years we have seen and heard about numerous global cyber-attacks, credit card thefts, and sensitive information leaked. These incidents have sparked an interest among organizations in hiring more ICT security specialists, so that they could protect their organizations from cyber-attacks.
IT support Officers are always in demand as well. Different organizations and industries including public administration, information technology, insurance, finance and retail trade hire them. IT Support Officers are always in demand but in current times the demand for this job has increased even more because they are crucial for business. According to an article published in technojobs.co.uk, IT support officers ranked number 2 in demand from employers in 2020. <b>(https://www.technojobs.co.uk/info/career-advice/10-most-in-demand-it-jobs-for-2020.phtml).</b>
Desktop support ranks 3rd in our group’s jobs ranking in demand from employers but the demand for Desktop support technicians is anticipated to increase by 10% in the coming years and this is more than any other occupation. In the past two years during the pandemic Desk Help was the second fastest growing job according to an article published by Joseph Tsidulko in CRN.
Cyber Security jobs are very in demand, that includes Cyber forensics Specialist as well. According to a study done by ECU Cyber Forensics ranked 10th in Cyber security jobs. This job has more to do with Criminal law and Forensics Science. Jobs in cyber security are projected to be stronger in coming years, the demand of cyber forensic professionals have also gradually increased but it still ranks lower than other jobs in our group.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, our ideal jobs are very different from each other that’s why it requires a wide range of skill sets. Some of these are higher in demand from employers.  Source: Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills)
We have a wide range of skills set in our group and it covers most of the top skills in demand but three top skills that are not in our skill set are as following,</p>

<p><b>IT skill set:</b> Business management, Business Analytics, graphic design.</p>
<p><b>General skill set:</b> Mentoring, Presentation, Multi-tasking.</p>
<p><b>Opinion on Ideal Jobs:</b></p>


<p>For<b> William Hansen,</b> his opinion on his ideal job (Cyber security specialist) has changed for a few reasons. First because of his age, he thinks that after looking at the data he realized that it will take a lot of time to complete a number of qualifications to get this job and secondly, it’s a difficult industry and hard to get a job at any age.</p>


<p><b>Alexander Ball’s</b> Opinion about his ideal job (IT support Officer) has not changed because he enjoys working in customer facing roles and he is eager to learn more skills. He thinks that his ideal job might change over the coming years but for now this is the best start.</p>


<p>Burning glass data has definitely changed <b>Samantha Kurilic’s</b> perspective on the greater need for her ideal job (Desktop support). Looking at this data, it has encouraged her to add more skills that are in demand to her experience and she believes it will give her greater opportunity for future positions and it will broaden the employment search and demand for her.</p>


<p><b>Madiha Sabahat’s</b> opinion has changed about the skills needed for the job. It's a constant learning field. Apart from having a degree a lot of skills are required, which need specific certificates to be completed. She thinks that before researching or looking at Burning glass data she didn’t realize the amount of IT specific skills or general skills required. It has motivated her to work hard to acquire the skills needed for her ideal job.</p>

<p><b><h1>IT Work.</h1></b></p>
 

<p>Bryce Honey from With You With Me <b>(WYWM)</b> was kind enough to give us time out of his busy schedule to allow us to Interview him as a part of our research into the work done by IT workers within the industry. Bryce described his role as that of a General Technologist, however that name doesn’t give him credit for all of the other functions or <b>“Hats”</b> that he has as a part of his role. Bryce is currently a Squad Leader within WYWM and is currently in charge of a small <b>“squad”</b> of people. This squad is currently assigned to a project that involves upgrading the Networking equipment, including switches, routers and firewall packet shapers, for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). As the <b>“Squad Leader”</b> Bryce is in charge of managing a significant amount of the project. As well as managing some of the overall aspects of the project he is also assisting with the actual configuration of some of the new equipment as well as doing the install of said equipment.
Bryce’s “Squad Members'' aren't the only people that he interacts with as a part of his role. Bryce has to liaise with a number of other people that are involved within this project. This current project that he and his squad is working on is contracted through IBM, as such he has to liaise with the Project Co-Ordinator of IBM. He does so on a daily basis as it is Bryce’s job to organise the delivery of most materials that will be needed for this upgrade. He also has to work with another person at IBM who is their Delivery Coordinator. He also has to work with Engineers from the RAN as the end customer to ensure that all of the Ships and Buildings will be available at the appropriate times as well that all of the environmental factors, such as heat and ventilation, are accounted for before installation begins. Finally Bryce also interacts with the CEO, CFO and CTO of WYWM on a daily basis as he is in-charge of the project; he has to report back to them on the state of the project among other things, such as sticking to budget and schedules. Overall Bryce interacts with a significant amount of other people as a part of his job including, Co-workers, subordinates, contract clients, end users as well as his own employers.</p>
<p>Bryce is lucky enough that his position allows him the luxury to work from home most of the time, and the pandemic has increased this even more. However once his current project is finished the planning stages he will have to travel to the sites to implement the process of installing all of the necessary components to complete the job. Most of his collaboration and communication is done online and through software such as Microsoft Teams and other text based chat programs. However even though he is so immersed in the IT field, Bryce is a big fan of picking up the phone and talking to someone directly as he believes that sometimes information can be <b>“lost in translation”</b> and it also helps to add a personal element to the interaction. Overall Bryce can do a vast majority of his work from home, however he does need to travel at times as a requirement of his position.
When Bryce was asked about what part of his position that he finds most challenging he was very quick to answer and revealed that it is something that he has to actively work on. Being <b>“Political”</b> when talking to the client is what he struggles with the most. Mostly he struggles to tell the client that they are incorrect while still trying to remain and communicate what he is trying to get across in a professional way. Because of his past history as a serving member of the RAN he sometimes struggles to stay in the mindset of being an IT Professional as opposed to being in a defence mindset. I find it quite interesting that Customer Service aspects can be quite difficult for some IT professionals due to the high majority of IT jobs being Support type roles.
Bryce’s answers to the questions asked were highly informative and gave us a great insight into the life of an IT professional and have also given us more information on what is waiting for us once we join the industry.</p>
 

 <h1>Group Reflection.</h1>
 


 <p>,b>Alex,</b> Team Reflection.</p>
<p>As a group I believe that we were able to work well together. Overall we were all able to work together on the overall Assignment while also being able to work independently on the sections that we agreed each person would focus on. We are of the consensus that we were able to split the load evenly between all of us to get the project done in time. One thing that could be improved however was our use of the Github repository. Instead of having everything saved in the one place on Github, by the end of the Assignment we had resources saved over both Microsoft Teams, Canvas and Github which then had to be collated close to submission. What surprised me the most about the group was despite how different we are (at least according to our test results from our profile) and how differing our ages and walks of life are, how well we were able to work together over the course of this assignment. The one thing that I have learnt about groups is that sometimes communication can break down if no one is willing to step up and take control of a situation, we were lucky enough that we always had someone willing to take control in these moments. Overall I think that we were able to work well as a team and I am looking forward to working with the rest of my team throughout this course.</p>

 <p><b>Sam,</b> Team Reflection.</p>
<p>My reflection of our team is definitely a positive one. We all worked really well together and were able to unpack what needed to be done in our assignment. We went through each section and each team member went away and completed their part. We all shared the role of chairperson and minute-taker in all five meetings and distributed these through email. We were able to then distribute assignment tasks, such as compiling data into an outcome evenly with a positive and team approach. 
What could have been improved was all the allocated tasks being saved in one space so it was easy to locate and we could see where we were up to; this would have allowed for a flow-on effect. 

I was surprised how quickly we all felt comfortable with each other and supported each other. One thing I have learnt working in a group is allocating tasks with timelines is really important and having a space where everyone saves their work. Being able, to be honest, have a laugh and be compassionate is also really important for the success of the team. And I personally feel that we all offer this to each other and look forward to working with our team for the rest of our studies.</p>   

 <p><b>William Hansen,</b> On Our Group Reflection.</p>

<p>We all worked very well together, playing to each other”s strengths and helping out if someone needed extra help. What could be improved, well we worked well together and communicated to each other on a regular bases, maybe more meetings but with each other’s everyday life duties that is a bit hard, but overall it was very good. The 1 thing that surprised me was how well we all got on, I don’t  usually get along with people, as I have been hurt before by people i would call my friends. The main thing I have learnt from this group is we have each other's backs and that's a good thing. And we trust each other to do our jobs. The tools we all used  were great and I am learning so much new stuff on how to use github and html and  everyone’s contribution  on canvas is awesome.</p> 



 <p><b>Madiha,</b> Team Reflection.</p>
<p>I resumed studies after a very long break and was very confused to work in a group but surprisingly everyone in our group was very comfortable with each other despite our different personalities and interests. Everyone contributed to their full extent and everyone completed their tasks in time. The best thing was that everyone put their best foot forward in every task including, chairing meetings, taking minutes or making Agenda before meeting.Chair person and minute taker for next meeting were decided at the end of every meeting and than Chairperson sent agenda for next meeting a day before the meeting.There was no communication barrier, everyone reached out as they desired and the other group members were happy to help. 
 One thing that I think could be improved is our contribution towards the GitHub repository and website, updating and saving our work there as we go along because it will be our main tool in future assignments. 
One thing that I have learned about groups from this experience is that if you have the right people around you who motivate you to give your best performance and brings the best out in you, it makes the difficult tasks easier and more enjoyable. I am looking forward to learning from and working with my group for the rest of the study period.</p>



 <p><b.Group Reflection:</b></p>
<p>We named our group The Non-Compatibles, because when we shared our profile test results from assignment 1, we realized that our personalities were very different from each other but during the course of these past three weeks our personalities have complimented each other very well. One person’s weakness is another person's strength and that worked well for us. Communication among the group members was commendable. Despite busy daily work and home routines and despite coming from different walks of life everyone made their best effort to make time and communicate. There was no communication barrier or fight for power/leadership. Everyone took turns in Chairing meetings, taking minutes and making an agenda. Our meetings were formal and professional but still friendly and a laugh here and there.   We all have different ideas of what we can improve and that is a good thing because it shows that we have more room for improvement and are driven to give our best performance. Areas where we could improve ourselves are use of GitHub repository, having more meetings, saving our allocated tasks and their progress in one place so it could be easily accessed.</p>
<p>The main thing was that everyone in the group was honest with each other about our profile test results, our assignment results and our feedback from Teacher and it gave us a chance to work through it and give our best performance. We all learned different things from our experience of being in a group. We realized that communication is the key, not waiting on others to step-up and reach out instead reaching out yourself when needed. We also learned that it is important to keep track and save the work we are doing so everyone can keep updated on the progress of the assignment. We all trusted each other in completing tasks and we also trusted in reaching out when we needed a hand because everyone was ready to help. Everyone contributed equally in completing the assignment. Sometimes in a group only few people actually do work and others hitch a free ride, but fortunately for us everyone stepped up and put in equal work. Surprisingly there were no arguments or disagreements during meetings as well.
We are all looking forward to improving ourselves, to learn from our shortcomings and everyone is eager to work with this group in future assignments and to learn from each other on the way.</p>

<h1><p>Project Idea.</p></h1>


<p><b>Project Idea:</b></p>

<p>For our project idea we have decided to go with Alex’s idea of an online Referee Platform. Alex’s original idea was to have it based at just Basketball Referees, but we have decided to produce it as a platform for Referees and Officials from all Sports.  Alex is heavily involved in Refereeing and teaching others to referee Basketball. He realised that there is currently no type of personal development system. Most of the current education is based around the passing of verbally learned knowledge to new officials and the gaining of experience on the court, as well as the very occasional theory session. We believe that there is an opportunity for a platform to be developed where referees and officials of all sports could go to access all the knowledge and materials needed for them. But this would also be a platform where they can also the officials can access other resources such as Rostering of games, Accreditation Tests, Reviews from Coaches, Reporting Resources and many other Resources that would be of assistance to the development of the officials and their association.</p>
 <p>This sort of project would be unique to our knowledge as there aren’t any platforms where you get all of this in one place. There are multiple platforms out there that offer rostering solutions, but I believe if you were to integrate something like them into a platform where you can also offer education and resources to officials there would be a massive benefit not only to the referees themselves but to the associations that they work at as there would be an increase in the quality of officiating of their games.
This platform would offer multiple services to both the officials and associations as a whole that would use it. It would offer a rostering service to the associations. This would include being able to import their competition’s schedule and allocate referees to each game to ensure that they have all games covered. It would also include features to ensure that officials aren’t rostered onto multiple games at the same time and would also be able to prevent other conflicts such as officiating games where they have family playing or refereeing at the same time as other commitments such as playing or coaching. There would also be the option for the users to put in their availability so that the association will know what officials are available for what games.
The next feature would be a cloud based repository that could be used to store any information that would be of use to the officials. Whatever the association wanted could be put in one place for the officials to access at will. This could be copies of the official rules, association bylaws or even copies of referee reviews. This would be a massive help to keep all their useful information in one place.</p>
<p>Another feature of the platform would be to have customisable forms available for use. There are many different uses that these could be used for, whether they be Referee Reviews or Player/Coach reports or even basic feedback forms. There would be many different uses that would be a benefit for all referees and associations that would use the platform, and they would all be customisable for whatever their individual use may be.
Another feature would be the one that would set this platform apart from others. Having a built in education to game assignment platform would be of massive benefit to the officials and their association. The education would involve training videos as well as tests/quizzes and other tools that can be used to develop officials at all levels. There would be resources that came with the platform but there would also be the option for associations to upload their own Videos or exams if they wanted to personalise something for their own association’s needs. The use of exams could be implemented and integrated into the game assignment part of the platform. Associations could have the choice of making their officials answer a certain amount for questions or watch a certain number of videos per week/month/season before they are able to be allocated towards games. This could become an annoyance to some so it would be an optional feature for the association to choose from. This is just where I would want to start this project and as it is developed, I am sure that even more features would be explored and developed as the project progressed.</p>
<p>This platform would be developed as a website to begin with. This would allow it to be accessed by the greatest number of officials and associations to begin with. Eventually once it is up and running and in a stable and usable state with all the original features implemented, We would start to transition it to an app-based platform. This would allow additional features to be added over the course of the development. One such feature would be to allow the user to record video and take pictures using the app on their phone and edit/upload them directly to the platform for education purposes. Another feature that would be able to be implemented once the platform is set up on an App is to let the user create game “Highlights' ' on the go. This feature would involve using the camera on the device to take short clips of the game that could then be automatically collated, and uploaded to the platform. The platform being an app would open up even more opportunities for growth and added features. However, it would create more issues with the development process because if it were to be transitioned to an app it would have to be based on all platforms to still allow everyone to access it. This means that it would have to be available on both Apple and Android devices while still being able to be accessed as a web page.</p>
As a part of Assignment 3 I believe that we could have at the very least the basic features of the platform created as a website. As a group we would develop the main landing page, as well as login access for the users. We would have the areas for Teaching materials to be uploaded as well as the online feedback forms. Some of the before mentioned aspects of the project will trigger a bit of a learning curve for our team due to the requirement to know how to use javascript as well as learn how to implement certain plug-ins. However, our existing knowledge of HTML and CSS will allow us to create the base of the website as a starting point.
<p>The use of the “Profile Builder” plugin would allow us to set up the login access for the officials and coaches. This would allow us to have different profiles for each official to login with. Without this we wouldn’t be able to set up the rostering feature of the platform. Having profiles will also allow educators to upload personalised feedback directly and privately to each individual official. It would also allow us to give more access to the makeup of the platform to the educators and association to make changes to suit their officials while restricting that access from the officials. Overall the profile builder would be an integral part of our final product.
The home page is the biggest part of the platform that we would have completed as a part of Assignment 3. The main feature of the home page would be the calendar/roster function. We would have a calendar view on the home page that would show the officials what upcoming games they have as well as if they have any allocated games that they need to accept/decline. As well as the calendar we would have a notification function that would have alerts for any feedback that had been given to them or if they had any required tests/accreditation due. We will also set up a menu function from this home page to allow the user to move through the platform to its other resources. This home page will be able to show everything of the most importance to the official with a simple glance.
We believe that we would be able to get close to a usable product with the skills that we currently already possess and with some continued learning and persistence we will be able to create a professional looking product.</p>
