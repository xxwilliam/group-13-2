<p><h2><b>Robotics:</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Robotics by Alex Ball.</b></p>

<p>A Robot, as defined by Britannica, is <b>“any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner”,</b>(robot | Definition, History, Uses, Types, & Facts, 2021). In this day and age this could describe many different things in our society, from household appliances like automatic coffee machines, to automatic assembly lines in car construction plant. All of these items are classified as <b>“Robots”</b> as they can perform tasks without human interaction. However, when someone is talking about a robot, most people would think of science-fiction characters such as R2-D2 and Optimus Prime instead of the items listed above that actually exist now, However the reality of having robots walking around and prevalent in our society isn’t as far away as you would think.</p><p> The <b>“AtlasTM“</b> by Boston Dynamics is one such Robot that is starting to reach the technology level that has up until recently only been seen in Science-Fiction.

The Atlas robot is able to run, jump, dance and perform moves such as backflips. The aim of the Atlas project is to push the bounds of robotics forward, and as such they have one of the most humanlike robots in existence. It is 1.5m tall and weighs approximately 90kg (Atlas, 2021). The team at Boston Dynamics have so far programmed the Atlas robot to do activities such as Dance, perform basic parkour and traverse obstacle courses. As such it is currently one of the most <b>“humanlike”</b> robots that exists today. At the other end of the spectrum are the robots that have been deployed in the automotive manufacturing industry since the 1960’s.</p><p> The original iteration of these robots was only originally used for spot welding, but their use has since grown massively. They are still used for welding, but they can now also move materials around and install them on the vehicle, paint and seal and cut away excess material. These robots are now a mainstay in the manufacturing industry and are crucial to the industries continued development.

Looking forward however, the future of the robotics field looks like it will be closing the gap between science and science-fiction.Recently Tesla announced plans to create its own <b>“Humanoid Robot”</b> (Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises serious concerns – but probably not the ones you think, 2021). This robot’s concept plans show that it looks very similar to a human.</p><p> The aim of the<b> “Tesla-Bot”</b> is to essentially be a robotic butler. When it was announced Elon Musk claimed that the Tesla-Bot could perform many varied manual labour tasks. This product could massively change how we live our lives. With this robot in every household, it would eliminate the need to go grocery shopping and even the task of cooking dinner. Not all of the impacts of this technology is good, it has the potential to limit the need for certain jobs and services. One such service that could be the food delivery service, this service has had a recent upturn in usage from the Covid-19 pandemic, but it could potentially be threatened by the development of this new technology.

The Tesla-bot, or another similar product, could also remove then need for Housekeepers/Nannies as it could have the technology needed to upkeep an entire household without the need to have someone employed in the role. While this technology has some obvious downsides in regards to potential job losses, it also has some other less obvious benefits. This technology could allow parents/partners to spend more time with their families as opposed to spending that time on domestic chores. It could also be of advantage to people that are time-poor and don’t have the time to ensure that they eat healthily. The robot could ensure that they have a healthy home cooked meal ready for them when they return home from work that could improve their health massively if they normally have to rely on Fast Food/Takeout due to time constraints. The people that would most likely be affected by this development in the technology are end users as they would be in the best position to benefit from the use of this product.If this product were to become a reality in the near future, I believe that it could have a massive impact on my life.</p>

<p>The potential time that I could gain by having a robot like the Tesla-Bot would allow me to make massive changes in my life. By eliminating the time needed to perform household chores such as cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping, I would have more time to focus on myself and my family. It would allow me to have more time to focus on my studies, and by extension set up the rest of my life/career. If I had more time to spend on studies, I could have my degree finished quicker as well as get a job in the industry a lot quicker than my current plans would allow. This could practically shave years off of my current life plan and allow me to live a better life quicker than would otherwise.</p>

<p><h2>Natural Language processing (NLP) and chatterbots.</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Natural language Processing and Chatterbots by Madiha Sabahat.</b></p>

<p>Natural Language Processing is a branch of Artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand spoken words the same way human beings can. It includes translation software, chatbots, spam filters, and search engines, grammar correction software, Predictive text, voice assistants, and social media monitoring tools. According to an article written in<b> “ZAPPY.AI”</b> talking about the current state of art in NLP, the author states that, By analysing text, computers infer how humans speak, and this computerized understanding of human languages can be exploited for numerous use-cases. Applications of NLP include sentiment analysis- where an NLP model can predict the kind of sentiment that a piece of text it operates upon expresses, virtual chat-bots- which are robots that interact with humans via text, having the ability to understand and provide logical responses to text messages sent by humans, speech recognition - technology commonly used in speech-to-text converters, now commonplace in mobile phones and video streaming websites, and several others.</p>

<p>State of the art techniques in NLP: Few of the NLP techniques include Optical character Recognition, Named entity recognition, Sentiment analysis, Text classification and Topic Modelling.<b> RNN:</b> Recurrent Neural Network is a widely used neural network architecture for NLP. It has proven to be comparatively accurate and efficient for building language models and in tasks of speech recognition.<b> LSTM’s:</b> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a modified version of recurrent neural networks, which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown duration.

As mentioned in an article in Zappy.Al, other state of art techniques in NLP are, The BERT mode, Transformer-XL and compressive transformers. Over the years NLP tools have evolved from recurrent neural networks (RNN’s) to Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM’s), leading upto the<b> “Transformer”</b> model architectures and several variants of the same, and some revolutionary new models.</p><p> Current applications in NLP include Customer service, Automotive, health care and many other. Daily we use different personal assistant devices including Google Home, Alexa, Cortana, Bixby. Everyone with a smartphone has access to them. In Health care NLP is doing revolutionary work, according to Global Hitachi solutions, primary use cases of Natural Language processing in Healthcare are Improving clinical documentation, accelerating clinical trial matching and supporting clinical decisions.

Future possibilities with NLP are endless. In an interview given to EMERJ, Vlad Sejnoha (Senior Vice President and CTO at Nuance since 2001) discussed future possibilities of NLP. Vlad talks about Nuance’s vision for a<b> “medical ambient intelligence”</b> using NLP technologies in healthcare. It includes Information discovery and retrieval, Diagnostic assistance, virtual health care assistant, Image classification and report generation. Some of the insights from the future vision of Vlad’s published in EMERJ, Human like virtual assistants, Information retrieval from unstructured data and Smart search in which Users will be able to search via voice commands rather than typing or using keywords.</p><p> Some of the areas which are on the peak of being transformed by natural language processing as mentioned in an article in ‘fast data science’ by Thomas are Health care, Pharmaceuticals, Finance and Legal and insurance.

NLP is being used for stroke treatment, suicide prevention, safety information in pharma, interpreting clinical trial protocols and legal document processing. He says in conclusion that <b>“Natural language processing" has already transformed a number of industries. However, certain areas such as healthcare and finance have been held back in the past by regulatory or ethical considerations, as well as the sheer practical difficulty of solving their big data problems with AI, despite possessing goldmines of unstructured text data. We have already seen machine learning transform the structured data in these industries, while natural language processing has tailed closely behind. We can look forward to huge and long-awaited improvements in healthcare, pharma, the law, insurance, and finance.”</b></p>

According to an article written by Gemma Chilton, Natural Language Processing is bridging the gap between computers and humans – and creating job opportunities for engineers with a knack for language. AI job opportunities are growing by the day, with high-profile players like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon vying for NLP researchers and engineers to join their companies. Natural Language processing already has a huge impact on our daily lives, mine too. Using personal assisting devices, including Alexa and google home. Email filters that help keep Junk and Spam emails away. Search engines have become so much better over time. I use Predictive a lot while writing formal documents and emails. Language Translation feature has helped a lot while traveling foreign countries or even making new friends. My grandfather lives alone and he uses personal assistance devices that are voice activated and it has made it very easy for him to perform tasks around the house, everything is voice activated including lights, TV, locks, etc. I never knew much about it before researching this topic but now I am looking forward to the future of NLP and how it will affect our daily lives.</p>

<p><h2>Autonomous Vehicles.</h2></p>
<p><b>Autonomous Vehicles by William Hansen.</b></p>

<p>What is an Autonomous Vehicle?In simple terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with little or no human interaction. Along a predetermined path in <b>“auto pilot”.</b> And a terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with a predetermined program to get there safely. Autonomous Vehicles have come a long way. Experiments started in the 1920’s, and trials began in the 1950’s. Jump to 1977 for example, the 1st semi-automated vehicle was developed by Japan’s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering lab. And that vehicle drove along a specially designed street with a top speed of 30 klms (19 mph). On an elevated rail. The tech back then was an analog computer and 2 cameras. Fast forward to the 5th of march, 2021, Honda introduced a limited edition Legend Hybrid EX. With a level 3 Automated driving , (See below for the different levels). But this vehicle was discontinued in June 2021. The technology involved is a range of different systems, including navigation systems, location systems, the global path planning, environment perception, laser perception, laser perception, radar perception, visual perception, vehicle control system.</p>

<p>All vehicles will need some form of machine vision, Eg (meaning it is a technology used to provide imaging-based analysis), and also some will have deep neural networks. Deep learning methods are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning, it can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from (real life driving). There are 5 (but if you count level 0 then it's 6) levels of driving automation.</p>

<p><b>Level 0.</b> Warning systems may monentinarly intervene but no sustained vehicle control, Reversing cameras, speedo checks.</p>

<p><b>Level 1. </b>(hands on) Driver controls steering and automated system controls speed or engine and brake power, eg cruise control.</p>

<p><b>Level 2. </b>(hands off) Automated system has full control of vehicle, eg speed,braking and steering, but the driver has to be prepared to intervene immediately if the system fails to respond properly.</p>

<p><b>Level 3.</b> (Eyes Off) The driver can text, or watch a movie and the vehicle will handle situations that call for immediate attention, eg emergency braking. The driver must still intervene within a short time.</p>

<p><b>Level 4. </b>(mind off). Same as level 3, but no driver attention required for safety. This is for vehicles in spatial areas ( geofenced) or under special circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Level 5.</b> (Steering wheel optional), No human intervention needed,sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>

<p><b>Info from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-driving_car#technol ogy.com</b></p>

<p>Full Autonomous Vehicles are a long way (decades) from being commercially viable as more technology is needed to ensure the safety of the public. What technology and other development needed to make this possible? More powerful sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems,and processors to execute software. Some safety and security cameras, AI,network infrastructure ,radar and lidar.</p>

What is the likely impact?

<p>The potential impact would have its pros and cons like any sort of development. The pros would be safer roads,more reliable transport, eg buses, taxis, trains. Cheaper for transport companies,on time deliveries, human’s spending more time with family and friends. The cons would be no transportation jobs truck drivers, taxi drivers and such. It will change how some people live, like re-training for other jobs like in the computer industry.IT. It will also help some people who have a disability, or people who have a fear of driving, less road rage incidents and traffic accidents. Potentially less deaths as well. But the loss of jobs may not be limited to the transport industry, Miners,smelt workers, may be affected as well due to the amount of natural resources used to make the vehicles, and even then people may look for artificialmaterial ( man made) to make the vehicles, eg the bodies of the vehicles, copper wire. Even the materials used to make the engines and tires, so more jobs may be lost or replaced. The social impact would not be good for those who are educationally challenged for them toget a job in the transport industry. Autonomous vehicles would have to be secured from hackers, other wise the transport vehicles could be used as land missiles, highly unlikely but it could happen, or the machines could take over. It would also greatly impact motor racing. Maybe.</p>

<p>How will this impact me?. It would greatly impact my life as I love driving my car, feeling the engine and being in control and not relying on a machine to do the driving. I don't think I could trust a computer no matter how good it is, for some of the reasons I have mentioned, corrupted software, hackers. I like to be in control of my life, but in saying that if they were to come on the market in a few years time I wouldn't have to teach my daughter how to drive. I have taught my wife and 3 sons to drive and all got their licence on the 1st try. So in reality it won’t have a big impact on my life at this point in time, but it might for my grandchildren and their children. Another big impact would be getting my deliveries on time, and as for an impact on my friends well i don't have any so no worry there and my family well my kids love driving as much as i do, And my son works at a tire place so it might have an impact on his life. Also having Autonomous vehicles would make us (human’s) a bit more lazy like in the movie (wally) where very thing was Automated.</p>
