<p><h2><b>Robotics:</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Robotics by Alex Ball.</b></p>

<p>A Robot, as defined by Britannica, is <b>“any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner”,</b>(robot | Definition, History, Uses, Types, & Facts, 2021). In this day and age this could describe many different things in our society, from household appliances like automatic coffee machines, to automatic assembly lines in car construction plant. All of these items are classified as <b>“Robots”</b> as they can perform tasks without human interaction. However, when someone is talking about a robot, most people would think of science-fiction characters such as R2-D2 and Optimus Prime instead of the items listed above that actually exist now, However the reality of having robots walking around and prevalent in our society isn’t as far away as you would think.</p><p> The <b>“AtlasTM“</b> by Boston Dynamics is one such Robot that is starting to reach the technology level that has up until recently only been seen in Science-Fiction.

The Atlas robot is able to run, jump, dance and perform moves such as backflips. The aim of the Atlas project is to push the bounds of robotics forward, and as such they have one of the most humanlike robots in existence. It is 1.5m tall and weighs approximately 90kg (Atlas, 2021). The team at Boston Dynamics have so far programmed the Atlas robot to do activities such as Dance, perform basic parkour and traverse obstacle courses. As such it is currently one of the most <b>“humanlike”</b> robots that exists today. At the other end of the spectrum are the robots that have been deployed in the automotive manufacturing industry since the 1960’s.</p><p> The original iteration of these robots was only originally used for spot welding, but their use has since grown massively. They are still used for welding, but they can now also move materials around and install them on the vehicle, paint and seal and cut away excess material. These robots are now a mainstay in the manufacturing industry and are crucial to the industries continued development.

Looking forward however, the future of the robotics field looks like it will be closing the gap between science and science-fiction.Recently Tesla announced plans to create its own <b>“Humanoid Robot”</b> (Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot raises serious concerns – but probably not the ones you think, 2021). This robot’s concept plans show that it looks very similar to a human.</p><p> The aim of the<b> “Tesla-Bot”</b> is to essentially be a robotic butler. When it was announced Elon Musk claimed that the Tesla-Bot could perform many varied manual labour tasks. This product could massively change how we live our lives. With this robot in every household, it would eliminate the need to go grocery shopping and even the task of cooking dinner. Not all of the impacts of this technology is good, it has the potential to limit the need for certain jobs and services. One such service that could be the food delivery service, this service has had a recent upturn in usage from the Covid-19 pandemic, but it could potentially be threatened by the development of this new technology.

The Tesla-bot, or another similar product, could also remove then need for Housekeepers/Nannies as it could have the technology needed to upkeep an entire household without the need to have someone employed in the role. While this technology has some obvious downsides in regards to potential job losses, it also has some other less obvious benefits. This technology could allow parents/partners to spend more time with their families as opposed to spending that time on domestic chores. It could also be of advantage to people that are time-poor and don’t have the time to ensure that they eat healthily. The robot could ensure that they have a healthy home cooked meal ready for them when they return home from work that could improve their health massively if they normally have to rely on Fast Food/Takeout due to time constraints. The people that would most likely be affected by this development in the technology are end users as they would be in the best position to benefit from the use of this product.If this product were to become a reality in the near future, I believe that it could have a massive impact on my life.</p>

<p>The potential time that I could gain by having a robot like the Tesla-Bot would allow me to make massive changes in my life. By eliminating the time needed to perform household chores such as cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping, I would have more time to focus on myself and my family. It would allow me to have more time to focus on my studies, and by extension set up the rest of my life/career. If I had more time to spend on studies, I could have my degree finished quicker as well as get a job in the industry a lot quicker than my current plans would allow. This could practically shave years off of my current life plan and allow me to live a better life quicker than would otherwise.</p>

<p><h2>Natural Language processing (NLP) and chatterbots.</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Natural language Processing and Chatterbots by Madiha Sabahat.</b></p>

<p>Natural Language Processing is a branch of Artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand spoken words the same way human beings can. It includes translation software, chatbots, spam filters, and search engines, grammar correction software, Predictive text, voice assistants, and social media monitoring tools. According to an article written in<b> “ZAPPY.AI”</b> talking about the current state of art in NLP, the author states that, By analysing text, computers infer how humans speak, and this computerized understanding of human languages can be exploited for numerous use-cases. Applications of NLP include sentiment analysis- where an NLP model can predict the kind of sentiment that a piece of text it operates upon expresses, virtual chat-bots- which are robots that interact with humans via text, having the ability to understand and provide logical responses to text messages sent by humans, speech recognition - technology commonly used in speech-to-text converters, now commonplace in mobile phones and video streaming websites, and several others.</p>

<p>State of the art techniques in NLP: Few of the NLP techniques include Optical character Recognition, Named entity recognition, Sentiment analysis, Text classification and Topic Modelling.<b> RNN:</b> Recurrent Neural Network is a widely used neural network architecture for NLP. It has proven to be comparatively accurate and efficient for building language models and in tasks of speech recognition.<b> LSTM’s:</b> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a modified version of recurrent neural networks, which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown duration.

As mentioned in an article in Zappy.Al, other state of art techniques in NLP are, The BERT mode, Transformer-XL and compressive transformers. Over the years NLP tools have evolved from recurrent neural networks (RNN’s) to Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM’s), leading upto the<b> “Transformer”</b> model architectures and several variants of the same, and some revolutionary new models.</p><p> Current applications in NLP include Customer service, Automotive, health care and many other. Daily we use different personal assistant devices including Google Home, Alexa, Cortana, Bixby. Everyone with a smartphone has access to them. In Health care NLP is doing revolutionary work, according to Global Hitachi solutions, primary use cases of Natural Language processing in Healthcare are Improving clinical documentation, accelerating clinical trial matching and supporting clinical decisions.

Future possibilities with NLP are endless. In an interview given to EMERJ, Vlad Sejnoha (Senior Vice President and CTO at Nuance since 2001) discussed future possibilities of NLP. Vlad talks about Nuance’s vision for a<b> “medical ambient intelligence”</b> using NLP technologies in healthcare. It includes Information discovery and retrieval, Diagnostic assistance, virtual health care assistant, Image classification and report generation. Some of the insights from the future vision of Vlad’s published in EMERJ, Human like virtual assistants, Information retrieval from unstructured data and Smart search in which Users will be able to search via voice commands rather than typing or using keywords.</p><p> Some of the areas which are on the peak of being transformed by natural language processing as mentioned in an article in ‘fast data science’ by Thomas are Health care, Pharmaceuticals, Finance and Legal and insurance.

NLP is being used for stroke treatment, suicide prevention, safety information in pharma, interpreting clinical trial protocols and legal document processing. He says in conclusion that <b>“Natural language processing" has already transformed a number of industries. However, certain areas such as healthcare and finance have been held back in the past by regulatory or ethical considerations, as well as the sheer practical difficulty of solving their big data problems with AI, despite possessing goldmines of unstructured text data. We have already seen machine learning transform the structured data in these industries, while natural language processing has tailed closely behind. We can look forward to huge and long-awaited improvements in healthcare, pharma, the law, insurance, and finance.”</b></p>

According to an article written by Gemma Chilton, Natural Language Processing is bridging the gap between computers and humans – and creating job opportunities for engineers with a knack for language. AI job opportunities are growing by the day, with high-profile players like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon vying for NLP researchers and engineers to join their companies. Natural Language processing already has a huge impact on our daily lives, mine too. Using personal assisting devices, including Alexa and google home. Email filters that help keep Junk and Spam emails away. Search engines have become so much better over time. I use Predictive a lot while writing formal documents and emails. Language Translation feature has helped a lot while traveling foreign countries or even making new friends. My grandfather lives alone and he uses personal assistance devices that are voice activated and it has made it very easy for him to perform tasks around the house, everything is voice activated including lights, TV, locks, etc. I never knew much about it before researching this topic but now I am looking forward to the future of NLP and how it will affect our daily lives.</p>

<p><h2>Autonomous Vehicles.</h2></p>
<p><b>Autonomous Vehicles by William Hansen.</b></p>

<p>What is an Autonomous Vehicle?In simple terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with little or no human interaction. Along a predetermined path in <b>“auto pilot”.</b> And a terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with a predetermined program to get there safely. Autonomous Vehicles have come a long way. Experiments started in the 1920’s, and trials began in the 1950’s. Jump to 1977 for example, the 1st semi-automated vehicle was developed by Japan’s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering lab. And that vehicle drove along a specially designed street with a top speed of 30 klms (19 mph). On an elevated rail. The tech back then was an analog computer and 2 cameras. Fast forward to the 5th of march, 2021, Honda introduced a limited edition Legend Hybrid EX. With a level 3 Automated driving , (See below for the different levels). But this vehicle was discontinued in June 2021. The technology involved is a range of different systems, including navigation systems, location systems, the global path planning, environment perception, laser perception, laser perception, radar perception, visual perception, vehicle control system.</p>

<p>All vehicles will need some form of machine vision, Eg (meaning it is a technology used to provide imaging-based analysis), and also some will have deep neural networks. Deep learning methods are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning, it can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from (real life driving). There are 5 (but if you count level 0 then it's 6) levels of driving automation.</p>

<p><b>Level 0.</b> Warning systems may monentinarly intervene but no sustained vehicle control, Reversing cameras, speedo checks.</p>

<p><b>Level 1. </b>(hands on) Driver controls steering and automated system controls speed or engine and brake power, eg cruise control.</p>

<p><b>Level 2. </b>(hands off) Automated system has full control of vehicle, eg speed,braking and steering, but the driver has to be prepared to intervene immediately if the system fails to respond properly.</p>

<p><b>Level 3.</b> (Eyes Off) The driver can text, or watch a movie and the vehicle will handle situations that call for immediate attention, eg emergency braking. The driver must still intervene within a short time.</p>

<p><b>Level 4. </b>(mind off). Same as level 3, but no driver attention required for safety. This is for vehicles in spatial areas ( geofenced) or under special circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Level 5.</b> (Steering wheel optional), No human intervention needed,sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>

<p><b>Info from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-driving_car#technol ogy.com</b></p>

<p>Full Autonomous Vehicles are a long way (decades) from being commercially viable as more technology is needed to ensure the safety of the public. What technology and other development needed to make this possible? More powerful sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems,and processors to execute software. Some safety and security cameras, AI,network infrastructure ,radar and lidar.</p>

What is the likely impact?

<p>The potential impact would have its pros and cons like any sort of development. The pros would be safer roads,more reliable transport, eg buses, taxis, trains. Cheaper for transport companies,on time deliveries, human’s spending more time with family and friends. The cons would be no transportation jobs truck drivers, taxi drivers and such. It will change how some people live, like re-training for other jobs like in the computer industry.IT. It will also help some people who have a disability, or people who have a fear of driving, less road rage incidents and traffic accidents. Potentially less deaths as well. But the loss of jobs may not be limited to the transport industry, Miners,smelt workers, may be affected as well due to the amount of natural resources used to make the vehicles, and even then people may look for artificial material ( man made) to make the vehicles, eg the bodies of the vehicles, copper wire. Even the materials used to make the engines and tires, so more jobs may be lost or replaced. The social impact would not be good for those who are educationally challenged for them toget a job in the transport industry. Autonomous vehicles would have to be secured from hackers, other wise the transport vehicles could be used as land missiles, highly unlikely but it could happen, or the machines could take over. It would also greatly impact motor racing. Maybe.</p>

<p>How will this impact me?. It would greatly impact my life as I love driving my car, feeling the engine and being in control and not relying on a machine to do the driving. I don't think I could trust a computer no matter how good it is, for some of the reasons I have mentioned, corrupted software, hackers. I like to be in control of my life, but in saying that if they were to come on the market in a few years time I wouldn't have to teach my daughter how to drive. I have taught my wife and 3 sons to drive and all got their licence on the 1st try. So in reality it won’t have a big impact on my life at this point in time, but it might for my grandchildren and their children. Another big impact would be getting my deliveries on time, and as for an impact on my friends well i don't have any so no worry there and my family well my kids love driving as much as i do, And my son works at a tire place so it might have an impact on his life. Also having Autonomous vehicles would make us (human’s) a bit more lazy like in the movie (wally) where very thing was Automated.</p>

<p><h2>Cyber Security,</h2></p>

<p><b>Cyber Security by Samantha Kurilic.</b></p>

<p>What is Cyber Security and what does it do? Cyber security is a practice known for protecting sensitive information and important critical systems, from digital attacks. A cyber attack can be detrimental to individuals and organisations computers and networks, why? It is an assault by cybercriminals using one or more computers. A cyber-attack can steal data, disable computers, or use a compromised computer or other devices as a launchpad for other attacks maliciously.   
In society, computers and devices such as Ipad’s, tablets, and smartphones are everyday devices that individuals use every day. This can start from internet banking, connecting with family and friends, online shopping, creating accounts with usernames and passwords and so much more.</p>
<p> Questions you would ask yourself is, are these usernames and passwords the same as your banking and online shopping with saved credit cards to keep consistency? How scary to think that if you chose generic login details and you had a security threat and you were hacked. In this instance, this proves it is super important to protect yourself from security threats.   
Important things to think about and to ensure you remain safe from cyber attackers, is to follow basic cyber security practices. Such as keeping your software up-to-date, install software patches, delete expired browser certificates and allow browsers to force HTTPS. Other protectors such as using a VPN, anti-malware, ensure you check emails before opening and secure online accounts.</p>
<p.What is Cyber security? Cyber security is a collection of processes, practices, technologies and security tools and it is used to protect software, devices, applications and more, inside and outside organisations. IBM topics, Cybersecurity-what is cybersecurity, paragraph 2.</p>
<p>The state of the art in cyber security is aimed to protect against security threats to ensure confidentiality, integrity and other private information remains secure and how amazing this invention is. The boundaries of the field of cybersecurity are constantly and rapidly evolving and it can be challenging to identify which areas have been researched and which ones remain overlooked or poorly understood.
As quoted by RAND <b>“The identified gaps include: a lack of research into cybersecurity within the national security context; the governance of cybersecurity; ethics and legal concerns; and a number of emerging topics such as the dark web, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and quantum-related technologies."</b> RAND Europe is unique and able to find evidence-based solutions to policy challenges in today's fast-changing times.
<b>“Daily reports on security incidents in companies and authorities show that there is an urgent need for action to improve IT security."</b></p><p> Article 32 of the GDPR regulates <b>"security of processing"</b> to ensure that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. ENISA and TeleTrust – IT Security Association, paragraph 2&3, published Feb, 7th, 2019.
A panel of Cyber Security Experts shared their views on what is next in Cyber Security via ‘IT Security Central, sponsored by Teramind. The following insight was from Stefan Maerz who is a cyber security engineer for Titan and Summit, two of the world’s fastest supercomputers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Stephen Maerz says <b>“Cyber security in 5 years,"</b> will not be all that different than it is today, to be honest — every year the Verizon data breach report comes out and it more or less tells us the same thing. We need to build security as a fundamental component of our technology architecture.. There is no easy button in security.</p><p> The state of the industry hasn’t evolved much in the past 5 years — I don’t foresee a reason it will change tremendously in the next 5”. Panel of Cyber Security Experts, IT Security Central, cyber security in five years the top experts speak.
What is the potential impact of this development? Cyber Security is definitely an area that needs more attention but unfortunately, it is given the least, it is a vast field of discussion in the IT sector and such a delicate area.<b> "Sauvik Acharjee says “</b> the lack of awareness and deprivation of knowledge about cybersecurity creates a more favourable situation for hackers. The first few words that pop up mostly in people’s minds after hearing the word <b>‘cyber security’</b> are about cyber-attacks by hackers on various international security forces and financial banks or theft of personal details of a company through bug attack.</p><p> Sauvik Acharjee, 19 Feb 2021, Jigsaw Academy.
Talking about the impact of cyber security on business, as reported by Jigsaw, “the first thing that came to mind, are two famous ransomware WannaCry and Not Petya which uses Eternal Blue exploit tool to damage 300,000 windows machines leaving victims to pay $300 to $600 as Ransom amount with an estimated data loss worth 19 million euros, according to the department of health and social care. Not Petya strike of 2017 created more hue and cry among the people leaving its impact of cyber security on society by hitting numerous large organizations throughout the world. A few of them were Maersk and FedEx whose data have been shared publicly showing a loss to that organization worth $250-$300 million. In 2015, a notable ransomware TeslaCrypt encrypted various file extensions linking to various online games leaving impact Minecraft hacks as encrypted for customers”.jigsawacademy/blogs/cyber-security/impact-of-cyber-security
According to IBM, It has been recorded in the US that the average data breach cost was 3.86 million globally and 8.6 million in the United States these costs are broken down into discovering and responding to the breach itself. This includes long-term reputation damage, the cost of the downtime that is involved and loss of revenue for the business and the brand itself. IBM topics, Cybersecurity-what is cybersecurity, paragraph 2.</P>      	
<p>Ecpi University has shared its views on how Cybercriminals affect and target individuals and not just large companies and organisations. <b>“While a CEO can afford a dedicated cybersecurity team," the average person is on their own when it comes to securing their computers and devices. That leaves millions of potential targets vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can range from the sort of data theft and ransomware that is used to target organizations to more personal attacks that aim simply to cause chaos and distress”.</b> Gainful Employment Information – Cybersecurity Track - Bachelor's
Being attacked by Cyber-attacks can be a real risk for me and my family, we rely on our smartphones to conduct all our banking, online shopping and my children watching their favourite content and setting up generic accounts to access all these streams. These attacks are real and the potential risk for me is no different than the next person, the only difference is, it depends on what security programs I access and how I manage my accounts with passwords, using VPN and removing previous browsing history.
This is a great insight on how cyber security can affect my family <b>“Although kids have an advantage in their almost innate grasp of the concepts of technology,"</b> they’re still kids. Their naivete puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to security in general and particularly on the internet. What’s worse, they often use the internet in secret. Some of the more shocking statistics show that 86% of girls aged 12-17 say they can chat online without their parents’ knowledge. Additionally, 57% say they can get into their parents’ email, which helps them circumvent parental controls.
By teaching children cybersecurity basics — including both the why and how — adults can prepare them for the risks they face and what to do when they encounter them. Plus, kids who grow up with a strong foundation in these practices can even begin to fill the cybersecurity skills shortage and help keep everyone safe”.
