<p><b><h2>Group processes</h2></b></p>
 
 <p><b>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing
  any changes in process for Assignment 3? This is new for this assignment.</b></p>
 
 <p>Our group worked really well on Assignment Two, we all contributed in a positive way 
 and worked very hard on each delegated task. We really helped each other out, offering
 advice and support for any queries we faced.</p> 

 <p>Assignment Two gave us an opportunity to get to know each other's IT experience,
 including how big or little experience we had. Alex Ball, samantha Kurilic and Madiha Sabahat were very professional in the planing phase, gathering information and task delegation for the Assignment. Our GitHub and website were built by William Hansen, and with his limited experience he is quite chuffed with the outcome. William also transferred the IT project onto gitHub and the Website.</p> 

 <p>As for this Assignment three, a few changes were identified and implemented, thses include using one google doc to gather all our work in one place, increasing communication via Teams meeting, chat functions and email. We also identified setting deadlines on all delegated tasks and keeping in contact with feedback and suggestions. Everyone is well aware of their allocated tasks and with more knowledge and practice we are working even better as a teamand using all the resources we can obtain. We are pretty confident that we will knock this Assignment out of the park.</p>


 <p><B><h2>Career plans</h2></b></p>
  
<p><b>Compare and contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs,for each person in the group. This may have changed due to 
feedback from Assignments 1 and 2. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, 
if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group? This is new for this assignment.</b></p>


<p><b><h2>Alexander Ball</h2></b></p>

<p>My Career plan is dependent on a few outside factors. My primary plan is to continue studying and to begin applying for
entry-level jobs. I have recently applied and had the first 2 interviews for an entry-level traineeship, that if I was to get
would change my entire plan. If I were to get this role I would be able to put my online study on the back burner for now and 
learn everything I needed for the role while on the job. I would also be mentored and coached, through further studies. Also be mentored and coached through further studies as a part of the role. If I don’t get the position I would continue along with what I am currently doing which is studying through RMIT and OUA part-time as well as applying for entry-level 1 
service desk roles, which is where I believe I would be able to develop and learn the most while not having much experience. 
I would then like to progress into a Network Analyst/Administrator Role. I find networks and servers very interesting and would like to experience and learn more about that field. After that, I would like to do some project management and run bigger projects once I have the skills and  knowledge required.</p>


<p><b><h2>Samantha Kurilic</h2></b></p>

<p>My career plan continues to be focused on IT desktop support, and cyber security. My short term plan is to continue studying with RMIT to be given more scope and develop my knowledge and skills. After completing Assignment Two, Industry Data, this has opened up my thought process and encouraged me to delve deeper and seek what is a highly sought role to think about. I have always had a keen interest in website development and programming also, so this is definitely something I will need to develop with ongoing studying. The end goal I see myself working as an entrepreneur offering my skills and services remotely, this will offer the ability to work flexibly and anywhere.</p> 

 
<p><b><h2>William Hansen</h2></b></p>
 
<p>My Career plans have changed form Assignment 1 and 2. 
It is still with Security but in regards with Domestic Violence Victims. I want to learn how to develop an App to help all
Domestic Violence Victims. The App would have things like GPS tracking, a panic button that would send out an alert to an 
organization or the police. To send help asap, too many people have been hurt or have passed away from Domestic Violence and 
this App would help and Women, Men and children. This App could be used to help other types of Violence like rape or abduction. It could also be ( in the near future placed in a piece of jewellery,) with a tiny button on it. This is very different from my 1st and 2nd Assignments ideal job or Career plans I had.</p> 
 

<p><b><h2>Madiha Sabahat</h2></b></p>

<p>My Career plans have changed a little bit after assignment 1 and 2. I had very little knowledge of IT and how can I progress my career in this field. I am currently studying through OUA and RMIT part time. After completing my current subject  I have enrolled in “Introduction to Programming”, then I plan to pursue Bachelors in Information Technology to 
start my career. I also want to start working in IT from a beginner level job along with my studies to gain experience 
in the field. I also want to achieve a few certifications and specializations in different aspects of IT to sharpen 
my skills and increase my knowledge. Somewhere down the lane I would like to pursue a masters degree in Cyber Forensics
and make it my permanent career</p>. 

  
<p><b><h2>Group Career Plans:</h2></b></p>

 <p>Career Plans in our group range from entry level jobs to entrepreneurship.<b> Alexander</b> and<b> Madiha</b> want to continue their studies as well as start an IT career from beginner level jobs. <b>Samantha</b> also wants to continue her studies through RMIT and later transit towards web development. After attaining experience and knowledge needed,<b> William</b> wants to continue his studies and has enrolled in Introduction to Programming and to work towards the project he is passionate about “ Developing an app to help domestic violence victims”.</p>

<p>Overall in our group all of us are on the starting point of our Careers. Most of us have a clear picture of our goals and want to work towards it steadily. <b>Alexander's</b> goal is to eventually do project management and run bigger projects after achieving skills and experience needed.<b>Madiha</b> wants to pursue a career in Cyber Forensics as well as get certifications and specializations in different IT aspects. <b>Samantha</b> wants to pursue her studies and later wants to start entrepreneurship as well as work remotely. <b>William</b> wants to pursue a career in app developing and work on his personal project. Everyone is passionate about their future plans and working hard towards their respective goals. It will take time as we are just starting but as they say taking the first step is all that matters.</p>

<p><b><h2>Topic</h2></b></p>

 <p> Our project was based on refereeing and officiating Basketball matches, but we have decided to expand to (eventually) all ball sports, i.e soccer, cricket, Afl, rugby league, and more. This is a personal development system, as most information is word of mouth or a course you can do that just covers the basics. The web site/app can be used for such things as official roasters, review from coaches, game stats, accreditation tests.</p>

 <p>Also Our project will help officials and referees with on hand rules and by-laws of the games. With a section on game schedules, video highlights of games, leaderboard of teams, and more when fully developed. But more so it will be a learning tool for new and a refresher for referees and officials to get up to date rules and by-laws. All this can be accessed on either laptop or mobile device.</p>

 <p>We think this will be an asset to any sporting club or organization, with drop down menus with easy access to what they're looking for. It will be done in a professional manner with clear side menus</p>


<p><b><h2>Motivation</h2></b></p>
 
<p>Alex: The Motivation behind this project is two pronged. The original idea came from Alex’s desire to have a platform for Basketball referees to have Scheduling, Education and development services all in one place. This combined with Sam’s original idea to have a platform to assist with the education of people with learning sign language moulded this project into what it has become, which is a platform that aims to include all sports and offers scheduling, education, individualised feedback and more. The goal is to have one platform for any official of anysport to come to to further their education and development in their chosen sport.</p> 

<p>This project fits into some current IT trends. It is being developed as a web based platform/application as essentially a learning platform. The aim of the project is to assist people in their personal and professional development as well as give them tools to assist them. Working on this project would show a future employer that the potential prospect has the skills to work together with a wide variety of people as well as has a wide range of skills that allowed them to help build and market this product.</p> 


 <p><b><h2>Landscape</h2></b></p>




 <P>There are a few similar products/systems available, but not in Australia. There’s one in the UK that does all kinds of sports, which is what the overall plan may be. We would like to include research with numerous testing methods for our overall product to be user-friendly and hopefully reflect this with the current products/systems on the market.</p>
 
 <p>Having a point of difference with the potential of virtual sporting referees and officials to answer any queries regarding, rules and laws of the game. Our product will have coaching reviews, training manuals for upcoming referees, referees and officials work roasters, areas for officials to report on games and the ability to create customer forms. Alongside this, game schedules, weather reports for outdoor games, game reviwes and stats on players, maps of where venues are, and much more.</p>
 
 Our product will be an ongoing development to ensure we stay ahead of current future trends, with deciated staff and officials, and up to date software and security. Technicians on call 24/7 for any techinical problems we may face and potential training in algorithms to help with training, coaching and refereeing.</p>


<p><b><h2>Aims</h2></b></p>

<p>The overall aim of this project is to provide sports officials with an online platform where they can have game schedules, education, feedback and resources all in one user-friendly location. We have started this project because we believe that there is a niche in the market for a platform such as this and that through creating this we would be able to help better and develop the various sports officials around the country, and potentially the world.</p>

<p>While this is our main overall aim, we have a few smaller goals, or checkpoints that we will need to achieve and prioritise along the way. The first goal is to get the main user interface up and running. This will include the home page and all of the different sub-pages that will be used to make up the website. The next step is to get the scheduling system up and running. The reason this is so important is because this is the main feature that is going to keep the users coming back consistently and we have to make sure that this is working well before we start to implement other features of the platform. The next main goal is to get the educational portion of the platform up and running. This is next because this will be the highest workload area of the development as it will include researching different rules and compiling educational materials as well as potentially collaborating with educators to develop our own learning material. Finally after that is complete, or at least progressing well, we would move onto implementing all of our other desired features.</p> 

<p>If we had to choose only one of these above goals. is to complete Our Project, due to time constraints or other constraints, it would be the educational aspect of the platform. This is because the educational aspect is what sets this platform apart from other game scheduling platforms, otherwise we would just be creating another platform that would be competing directly with other existing products.</p>

 <p><h2><b>Scope and limits</b></h2></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p><h2><b>Tools And Technologies</b></h2></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p><h2><b>Testing</b></h2></p>
 
<p>Testing Our Product will have its ups and downs as all new products. So in Testing Our product we will do a trial run with Basketball, Writing up all the rules and regulations, and examples of certain games plays, which more games can be added at any time. To help the Referees. When our product is ready for Testing we will ask about 5 or 6 Referees and officials to have a free trail run for a few weeks, and ask them to provide feedback on how it all went, and if it was easy to use, and had simple explanations, and what could make it better eg. Faster, more content, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>All sporting Referees and Officials will be shown how to use our Website on a laptop or mobile device, upon receving the feedback we will have a better understanding of what their needs and any concerns are. It will also gives us more ideas on how to develop the website for certain other sports in the future. As Our Product is aimed at sports (eventually other sports) it will have the same features , just different rules and codes. But just as easy to understand. While Our Product is being tested our staff will monitor how often it is used, and make sure it runs smoothly and no "dropouts".</p>

<p>After the trail period a samll questionnaire will be given 4 to 5 questopns and if any major changes are needed. And also ask them if they would continue to ues Our Product, when it gets up and running in full. Our Product will have regular updates, to ensure Pur Product is up to dat with any new regulations and by-laws and security.</p>


<p><h2><b>Timeframe</b></h2></p>






<p><h2><b>Risks</b></h2></p>

<p> We have chosen to use AWS for Our project. As AWS is one of the most popular web services, and on-demand cloud computing platforms. Alex has been getting familiarized on how to use AWS. Just like how we got to know GitHub. The risks besides the generic ones (those who shall not be named) are like the ones we take when tryng out new things some times it works ant some times it don't work but as we have only had a limited amount of time ( not months ) but only a few weeks. This is a trail and error. Some of the risks we mat encounter are the software or trying to put in place some features that the platform wont let us,but with Alex working hard on it we are sure to overcome this. Some of the other risks are AWS could get shut down or hacked, our hardware could fail, Earthquakes, fires, that sort of thing. Things that are out of our control, another risk is poor communication between out group.</p>



 
 
<h1><p>Project Idea.</p></h1>


 <p><b><h2>Project Idea:</h2></b></p>

<p>For our project idea we have decided to go with Alex’s idea of an online Referee Platform. Alex’s original idea was to have it based at just Basketball Referees, but we have decided to produce it as a platform for Referees and Officials from all Sports. Alex is heavily involved in Refereeing and teaching others to referee Basketball. He realised that there is currently no type of personal development system. Most of the current education is based around the passing of verbally learned knowledge to new officials and the gaining of experience on the court, as well as the very occasional theory session. We believe that there is an opportunity for a platform to be developed where referees and officials of all sports could go to access all the knowledge and materials needed for them. But this would also be a platform where they can also the officials can access other resources such as Rostering of games, Accreditation Tests, Reviews from Coaches, Reporting Resources and many other Resources that would be of assistance to the development of the officials and their association.</p>
 
 <p>This sort of project would be unique to our knowledge as there aren’t any platforms where you get all of this in one place. There are multiple platforms out there that offer rostering solutions, but I believe if you were to integrate something like them into a platform where you can also offer education and resources to officials there would be a massive benefit not only to the referees themselves but to the associations that they work at as there would be an increase in the quality of officiating of their games.</p>
 
<p>This platform would offer multiple services to both the officials and associations as a whole that would use it. It would offer a rostering service to the associations. This would include being able to import their competition’s schedule and allocate referees to each game to ensure that they have all games covered. It would also include features to ensure that officials aren’t rostered onto multiple games at the same time and would also be able to prevent other conflicts such as officiating games where they have family playing or refereeing at the same time as other commitments such as playing or coaching. There would also be the option for the users to put in their availability so that the association will know what officials are available for what games.</p>
 
<p>The next feature would be a cloud based repository that could be used to store any information that would be of use to the officials. Whatever the association wanted could be put in one place for the officials to access at will. This could be copies of the official rules, association bylaws or even copies of referee reviews. This would be a massive help to keep all their useful information in one place. Another feature of the platform would be to have customisable forms available for use. 
 There are many different uses that these could be used for, whether they be Referee Reviews or Player/Coach reports or even basic feedback forms. There would be many different uses that would be a benefit for all referees and associations that would use the platform, and they would all be customisable for whatever their individual use may be.</p>
 
<p>Another feature would be the one that would set this platform apart from others. Having a built in education to game assignment platform would be of massive benefit to the officials and their association. The education would involve training videos as well as tests/quizzes and other tools that can be used to develop officials at all levels. There would be resources that came with the platform but there would also be the option for associations to upload their own Videos or exams if they wanted to personalise something for their own association’s needs. The use of exams could be implemented and integrated into the game assignment part of the platform. Associations could have the choice of making their officials answer a certain amount for questions or watch a certain number of videos per week/month/season before they are able to be allocated towards games. This could become an annoyance to some so it would be an optional feature for the association to choose from. This is just where I would want to start this project and as it is developed, I am sure that even more features would be explored and developed as the project progressed.</p>
 
<p>This platform would be developed as a website to begin with. This would allow it to be accessed by the greatest number of officials and associations to begin with. Eventually once it is up and running and in a stable and usable state with all the original features implemented, We would start to transition it to an app-based platform. This would allow additional features to be added over the course of the development. One such feature would be to allow the user to record video and take pictures using the app on their phone and edit/upload them directly to the platform for education purposes. Another feature that would be able to be implemented once the platform is set up on an App is to let the user create game “Highlights' ' on the go. This feature would involve using the camera on the device to take short clips of the game that could then be automatically collated, and uploaded to the platform. The platform being an app would open up even more opportunities for growth and added features. However, it would create more issues with the development process because if it were to be transitioned to an app it would have to be based on all platforms to still allow everyone to access it. This means that it would have to be available on both Apple and Android devices while still being able to be accessed as a web page.</p>
 
<p>As a part of Assignment 3 I believe that we could have at the very least the basic features of the platform created as a website. As a group we would develop the main landing page, as well as login access for the users. We would have the areas for Teaching materials to be uploaded as well as the online feedback forms. Some of the before mentioned aspects of the project will trigger a bit of a learning curve for our team due to the requirement to know how to use javascript as well as learn how to implement certain plug-ins. However, our existing knowledge of HTML and CSS will allow us to create the base of the website as a starting point.</p>
 
<p>The use of the “Profile Builder” plugin would allow us to set up the login access for the officials and coaches. This would allow us to have different profiles for each official to login with. Without this we wouldn’t be able to set up the rostering feature of the platform. Having profiles will also allow educators to upload personalised feedback directly and privately to each individual official. It would also allow us to give more access to the makeup of the platform to the educators and association to make changes to suit their officials while restricting that access from the officials. Overall the profile builder would be an integral part of our final product.</p>
 
<p>The home page is the biggest part of the platform that we would have completed as a part of Assignment 3. The main feature of the home page would be the calendar/roster function. We would have a calendar view on the home page that would show the officials what upcoming games they have as well as if they have any allocated games that they need to accept/decline. As well as the calendar we would have a notification function that would have alerts for any feedback that had been given to them or if they had any required tests/accreditation due. We will also set up a menu function from this home page to allow the user to move through the platform to its other resources. This home page will be able to show everything of the most importance to the official with a simple glance. We believe that we would be able to get close to a usable product with the skills that we currently already possess and with some continued learning and persistence we will be able to create a professional looking product.</p>
